    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application
      <strong>“Gym Tracker”</strong> (also referred to as <strong>“OfflineGym”</strong>,
      hereinafter the “App”) handles your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App is designed for <strong>personal offline workout tracking</strong> and can be used
      without creating an account or registering in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Store and Process</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Personal information</h3>
    <p>
      The App does <strong>not require you to provide your name, email address, phone number, or
      any other personal information</strong> in order to function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App does <strong>not create user accounts</strong> and does <strong>not link any data to
      your real-world identity</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2. Workout data</h3>
    <p>
      The App may store the following data that you enter yourself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exercises and workout templates;</li>
      <li>Sets, reps, weights and other workout parameters;</li>
      <li>Workout dates and basic statistics;</li>
      <li>Optional notes or comments you add to your workouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>All of this data is stored locally on your device</strong> and is used only to show
      your history and statistics within the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Network Communication</h2>

    <h3>3.1. No automatic data transfer to the developer</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of this Privacy Policy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App does <strong>not send your data</strong> to the developer’s servers;</li>
      <li>The App does <strong>not sync your data with the cloud</strong> by default;</li>
      <li>The App does <strong>not automatically share your data with any third parties</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2. Export and import of data</h3>
    <p>
      The App may provide features such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Export</strong> of your data (for example, to a CSV or backup file);</li>
      <li><strong>Import</strong> of data from backup files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These operations are performed <strong>only when you explicitly choose to use them</strong>.
      You decide where to store these files (for example, on your device, in a cloud storage
      service, or elsewhere).
    </p>
    <p>
      The developer has <strong>no access</strong> to your exported files and is
      <strong>not responsible</strong> for how or where you store, share, or publish them.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ads and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      At the time of this Privacy Policy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App <strong>does not contain in-app advertising</strong> (no banners, interstitials, or rewarded ads);</li>
      <li>The App <strong>does not use third-party analytics services</strong> (such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If advertising or analytics are added in future versions, this Privacy Policy will be updated
      accordingly, and the required disclosures will be made in the app store listing and/or within
      the App itself.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the features you use, the App may request certain permissions, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access to storage / files</strong> – to export and import workout data or backup files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All permissions are used strictly for the functionality described and are
      <strong>not used for hidden data collection</strong>.
      You can manage or revoke these permissions at any time in your device’s system settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because all workout data is stored locally on your device, its security largely depends on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your device’s security settings (screen lock, PIN, password, biometrics);</li>
      <li>how you manage and store backup files;</li>
      <li>how you handle access to your device and accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The developer <strong>cannot access</strong> your local data and therefore
      <strong>cannot restore it</strong> if it is deleted due to app removal, device reset, loss of
      the device, or manual deletion by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended to periodically create and store backups of your workout data (if the App
      provides such an option) in a secure location.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Health and Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The App may be used to track workouts, body weight, or other fitness-related information.
      However:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App is <strong>not a medical device</strong>;</li>
      <li>The App <strong>does not provide medical advice</strong> or diagnosis;</li>
      <li>All information in the App is for <strong>informational and personal fitness purposes only</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before starting any new workout program, especially if you have existing health conditions,
      you should consult a qualified healthcare professional.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>
      As a user, you have full control over the data you enter into the App. In particular, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose not to enter any workout data at all;</li>
      <li>Delete specific workouts, exercises, templates, or other records inside the App;</li>
      <li>Uninstall the App, which may remove locally stored data from your device (depending on your operating system’s behavior).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the developer does not store your data on any server and has no remote access to it, the
      developer <strong>cannot view, modify, or delete your data on your behalf</strong>. All such
      actions must be performed directly on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the App evolves or if
      legal requirements change.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this Policy is updated, the “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised.
      In case of significant changes, updated information may also be provided in the app store
      listing and/or within the App itself.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>

      can contact the developer at:
